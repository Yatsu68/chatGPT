Here is just an other version of the call to the API.
This time we directly use openai package in npm (still with expressjs and bodyparser).
We thus make call to the API in a simpler wat. I recommand using this version.
You still need an API key to use this though.

Don't forget to read the README.md file in the chatGPT/ directory in order to get some more important details.
