Hey, here is the first version of the API call to use davinci-003 engine/model. You can look at it but I would rather advise you to use the second Version, because it's way simpler and straightforward.

This version was created when I was looking to make post request by myself in order to improver my REST API usage expression, the V2 uses the openai package that is present in npm and yarn and which greatly simplifies the calls to the API.

Don't forget to read the README.md file in the chatGPT/ directory, you can have some details on these projects.
