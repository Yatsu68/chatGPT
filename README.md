Hey, hope you're good! 
Here are some informations you have to take note of:

In order to use this code:
  - You need to write your API key in the config.json (replace "XXXX" by your key)
  - You need to have the required packages installed from npm or yarn in your project (express.js and body-parser should be enough)

To get an API Key, it is necessary to create an account on: https://platform.openai.com/.
Once your account is created you can click on the top right button on the navbar and click "View API Keys", then you can generate API Keys.

Note that you must never give this key to anyone, otherwise ill-intentioned people may cause you trouble.

Have a fun time!
